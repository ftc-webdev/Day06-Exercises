# Day 06 – Exercises – 10/10/23
Just to note that there were no Day05 exercises. I’ll include them today.
The Modal/Showcase Modal exercises are quite challenging, so I would leave them to last. Focus on
Task 01 & 02.
I will push the code for Tasks 01 & 02 tomorrow as soluƟons.
## Task 01 – Cookie/html5 local storage:
The company would like to use a cookie/html5 local storage variable to remember customers. They
would like a simple greeƟng such as “Hello XXX” to be displayed on the page for returning or current
users. Implement a suitable client side script to allow for this feature
### Pseudocode
We need some code to try to load the user name from local storage.
If the value does not exist, then we need the user to register their name. We need an input box, and
buƩon, with some code to handle the registraƟon process. Don’t forget to save the user name to
local storage.
If the value does exist, display the user name with a nice message, and a buƩon allowing the user to
logout.
When the user logs out, remove the user name from local storage.
### Enhancements
- Replace the user name value with a user object.
- Create a User() constructor funcƟon, to create a user object….name & age properƟes, or something
similar.
- Input fields for each property – name & age. Use inputs to create the object, and save the object to
local storage. You will need to use JSON.stringify().
- If the object exists in local sƟrage. Display the data, along with logout buƩon. If the user object does
not exist, call the register funcƟon, to display the input fields.
- One final exercise might be to add 2 buƩons to the page, to create data, and to read data from local
storage. In this case we will store an array of objects. Again we will need JSON.stringify() and
JSON.parse().
## Task 02 – Scroll Top
Some of the webpages are geƫng very long. To increase usability and to accommodate mobile layout
also, add a scroll/slide buƩon to the page that appears aŌer one scroll length of the page and when
clicked the user is brought back to the top of the page. Implement a suitable client side script to
allow for this feature.
### Pseudocode
You can use w3schools as a source for a soluƟon to this problem. Or any other suitable web resource.
Make sure you modify the code to suit your own coding style.
Ensure you use the more modern features – let/const v var, arrow funcƟons, addEventListener
instead of onclick etc.
Try to create it as a module, which can be used on any website. You should probably generate the
button and the CSS from inside the module. Consider using the css module from an earlier task.
## Task 03 – Popup/Modal Box
The company has a special offer file which they can edit and upload as they wish. However, this is
currently only available by email request from the customer. The company would like a buƩon on the
website which displays current special offers on request from the user in a set dimension window.
Implement a suitable client side script to allow for this feature.
This code has already been pushed to GitHub as Task08 – Modal, and Task 09 – Showcase-Modal.
However, the code is not very well behaved. Explore the code base and see if you can improve the
code stability, and visual appearance.
